# Architecture

## What this repo is

One folder holding most of what its owner writes, across every language, so that an agent
working in this directory can scan it, cross-reference it, and reuse it without anything
being published first. Source-level reuse is the point. Publishing a package is something a
library earns after it stabilises, not a precondition for using it.

## Layout

```
spec/       Rules. Start at CLAUDE.md, which indexes this directory.
libs/       Libraries, any language.
apps/       Deployable things, any language.
data/       Binary assets. In the tree, never in git.
projs/      Reserved for large standalone projects. Not created yet.
```

## One name, one thing

A directory under `libs/` is a namespace, not a language choice. `libs/imgsrc` is imgsrc
-- whether that is a Cargo crate, a TypeScript package, or a Rust core with a TypeScript
wrapper around it is an implementation detail living inside.

This is what makes the cross-language plan work: a library whose core is Rust compiled to
wasm and whose surface is TypeScript is still one directory with one name. Splitting
libraries by language at the top level would tear that library in half.

The same applies to `apps/`. A Rust binary and a SvelteKit site sit side by side, named for
what they do.

## Libraries export source

A TypeScript library's `exports` point at `./src/*.ts`, not at a built `dist/`. There is no
build step, no `dist/`, and no `prepare` script to run before the repo works.

This is the whole point of the repo. A library that must be built before it can be used is a
library with a publishing ritual attached, and that ritual is exactly what stops code from
accumulating. Consumers here are bundlers -- Vite, the Workers runtime, esbuild -- and they
compile TypeScript directly.

The constraint: this holds only while every consumer bundles. A consumer that runs raw
Node against the package would need a build. If that day comes, add the build to that one
library rather than reinstating it everywhere.

## Workspace wiring

The two package managers disagree about strictness, and the layout has to respect that.

**pnpm globs.** `pnpm-workspace.yaml` uses `libs/*` and `apps/*`. pnpm only picks up
directories containing a `package.json`; Rust-only directories are invisible to it. Adding a
Rust library requires no pnpm change.

**Cargo does not glob.** `Cargo.toml` lists members by hand. Cargo errors on any
glob-matched directory that has no `Cargo.toml`, and that error breaks _every_ cargo command
in the repo, not just the one crate. Verified: with `members = ["libs/*"]` plus an `exclude`
list, adding one TypeScript library and forgetting to exclude it takes the whole workspace
down. With explicit members, new TypeScript libraries have no effect at all.

The cost is one line in `Cargo.toml` per Rust crate. The failure it buys off is a hard stop
triggered by the most routine action in the repo.

## Naming

One word, or an abbreviation that can be read aloud. Roughly 4 to 8 characters. Lowercase,
no hyphen unless the name is genuinely two words. See [naming.md](naming.md) for the
filesystem rules that apply inside these directories.

Name for responsibility, never for deployment shape or product. `cdn` describes what it is;
`res` described a slot it happened to occupy. Product and domain names are the worst
candidates of all -- they change. A domain that was a content site can become a redirect
without a single line of its code changing.

## Grouping threshold

`apps/` is flat. Introduce a grouping directory only once one category exceeds four members,
and let the growth force it rather than predicting it. Four apps do not need a taxonomy;
`api` and `cdn` announce themselves as infrastructure without a parent directory saying so.

## Where volatile facts live

Directory structure is the skeleton: expensive to change, so it may only carry stable facts.
Which domain an app answers on is not stable. That mapping belongs in a typed map in a
library, where changing it is a one-line edit instead of a rename plus every import plus the
workspace globs.

### Every URL is declared once

`libs/urls` is the only place a URL, hostname, or dev port may be written down. Everything
else imports from it. This covers third-party endpoints too, not just our own hosts -- a CDN
we forward images through is as much a URL as a domain we own.

The URL map is grouped by role:

- `apps`: deployable things in this repo, with development and production entries.
- `internal`: domains the repo owner controls, but that are not apps in this repo.
- `external`: third-party endpoints and hostnames.

Nothing outside that library may contain a literal `http://`, `https://`, `localhost:`, or a
bare hostname **that the running system resolves**. Not app code, not a library, not a
stylesheet, not a config file, not a spec document.

What this does not cover: citations. A markdown link to an external standard, or a `# see <url>`
comment, is a reference for a reader and never resolved by the software. Those stay where they
are useful. The distinction is whether changing the URL would change behaviour -- if moving a
host silently breaks something, it belongs in `libs/urls`; if it only breaks a reader's
curiosity, it does not.

The measure this exists to protect: **moving a domain costs one edit to one file.** Every
literal written elsewhere adds one more place that has to be found, and the ones that get
missed do not fail loudly -- they keep resolving to the old host until someone notices the
traffic. This has already happened here once: a `cdn.canmi.net` literal survived inside a
library long after that host stopped being part of the URL map, invisible because nothing
referenced it by name.

Colors follow the same shape at a smaller scale: OKLCH values are declared in
`libs/tokens` and consumed by name. The rule covers the design system that the site's own UI
and theme are built from; a palette mirrored from an external convention keeps whatever
format that convention ships.

`robots.txt` follows the same shared-base shape, and lives in `libs/robots` rather than in
`libs/urls`. It exports the minimal common definition plus a helper that appends site-specific
rules -- disallowed paths, sitemap entries -- so each site owns its additions while a change to
the shared policy reaches all of them at once. It sits in its own library because generating a
file is not the same job as mapping URLs, even though it consumes them.

## Data

`data/` holds photos and other binary assets. It sits in the tree so agents and local tools
can reach it, and is excluded from git wholesale; only `.gitkeep` is tracked, so a fresh
clone still has the mount point. It syncs to R2 and is backed up to the NAS.

**Backup ignores are not git ignores, and one file cannot serve both.** The sets overlap on
build output and caches, which neither wants, but they disagree on exactly the content that
matters: `data/` is excluded from git and is the most important thing in the backup.

Driving backups from `.gitignore` therefore drops every photo, silently. Driving git from the
backup list commits gigabytes of build output. Each needs its own list; `.gitignore` is git's
and is not to be reused for anything else.
